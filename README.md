# symphart

An introduction to Sympfony 4.

## Baby steps for development:

Install Composer (globally)
![Composer download and install globally](./docs-assets/composer-1.png)
![Composer moved to path](./docs-assets/composer-2.png)
Check with command: `composer -V`.

Then navigate to directory "/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/sites" (or your public web server directory) and create a new Symfony proyect with this command: `composer create-project symfony/skeleton symphart`.

> **NOTE:** I created this project inside a folder called "sites" but you can skip that folder if you prefer create a virtual host. Another option is use "Symfony PHP web server" as described after.  


Start your web server (Apache) and load in your browser this URL: `http://localhost/sites/symphart/public/`


> **TIP:** You can create a basic `.htaccess` file inside "/public" folder.  

Install "Symfony PHP web server" using command: `composer require symfony/web-server-bundle --dev`.

Creater your first controller:
```
// src/Controller/ExampleController.php

<?php
	namespace App\Controller;

	use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

	class ExampleController {
		public function index() {
			return new Response('<html><body><h1>It's just an example</h1></body></html>');
		}
	}
```

And define your first route:
```
// config/routes.yaml

index:
   path: /
   controller: App\Controller\ExampleController::index
```

For start server in development mode: `php bin/console server:run`. Observe how a web server start serving your applicattion on localhost on an specific port.

Et Voil√†! You are ready to work.

#### Optional development steps:
* Install Annotations to define routes inside controllers: `composer require annotations`
* Install Twig as template engine: `composer require twig`
* Install Doctrine: `composer require doctrine maker`. 
	* If you want to use a database, you must create a copy of file `.env` and rename as `.env.local` and then define your SQL credentials and database name. 
	* Then execute `php bin/console doctrine:database:create`. 
	* Now you can create entities with the command `php bin/console make:entity Foo` (where "Foo" will be the name of entity). You can use the same command to update an existing entity
	* Execute `php bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff` to create migration file. Database migrations are a way to safely update your database schema both locally and on production. Then execute the migration with the command `php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate`. Now your database will be upgrade to new structure.

#### Tips for development:
* Examinate your routes: `php bin/console debug:router`
